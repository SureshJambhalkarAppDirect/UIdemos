## APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE & NAPKIN CREATION GUIDELINES

### Current Architecture Overview
This application uses a clean, decoupled architecture with React Router for URL management:

```
/ â†’ Landing Page (AppConnectors UI Napkins)
/lga-flow/* â†’ AC-14371: Large Government Agencies (fully isolated)
/company-flow/* â†’ Company Flow: Adobe Vendor Setup (fully isolated)
```

Each flow is completely independent with:
- âœ… Own routing and URL management
- âœ… Own navigation and state management  
- âœ… Zero dependencies on other flows
- âœ… Isolated functionality that can evolve independently

### Adding New Napkins/Flows

**When user wants to add a new napkin, they should provide:**

#### 1. Basic Details
- **Display Name**: What appears on napkin card (e.g., "AC-12345: New Feature Flow")
- **Route Path**: Desired URL path (e.g., `/new-feature-flow`)
- **Color**: Hex color for napkin theme (e.g., `#22c55e`, `#f59e0b`, `#8b5cf6`)

#### 2. Flow Type (Choose one)
- **Option A**: "Create new flow from scratch"
- **Option B**: "Use existing component: [ComponentName]"  
- **Option C**: "Copy structure from: [existing flow like LGA or Company]"

#### 3. Content/Functionality (if new)
- Brief description of what the flow should do
- Any specific pages/views needed
- Any special navigation requirements

#### Example Request Format:
```
"Add a new napkin:
- Name: 'AC-15892: Partner Management'  
- Route: `/partner-flow`
- Color: `#8b5cf6` (purple)
- Type: Create new flow from scratch
- Content: Should have a partners list page and partner detail page"
```

### Implementation Process
When adding a new napkin, automatically:
1. âœ… Add napkin card to `LandingPage.tsx`
2. âœ… Create route in `App.tsx`  
3. âœ… Create flow container component (`[Name]Flow.tsx`)
4. âœ… Set up internal navigation structure
5. âœ… Ensure complete isolation from existing flows
6. âœ… Follow established URL patterns and routing architecture

### Architecture Benefits
- **Zero Impact**: New flows don't affect existing flows
- **Consistent Patterns**: All flows follow same architectural structure  
- **URL Management**: Proper routing with bookmarkable URLs
- **Scalability**: Easy to add/modify/remove flows independently
- **Browser Support**: Back/forward navigation works correctly

### Critical Preservation Rules
- **AC-14371 (LGA Flow)**: Must never be disrupted - contains major functionality
- **Company Flow**: Must remain completely separate from AC-14371
- **Flow Isolation**: Each flow must be completely self-contained
- **URL Structure**: Maintain clean, predictable URL patterns
